Add Location class
create int x and y
Change from class to struct

Create a Board class
create static dimension = 20
create static width and height = 10
cache a reference to gfx object
Create a constructor that initializes graphics
Create DrawCell function pass Location and color 
Add brd to Game.h and include random num generator

(We need to get width and height from board)
Make disco fever! (or diSCo sEizUre!!!)

Create Snake class and Segment class inside Snake
Add location and color into Segment

Create segments array and make it 100
Create int nSegments = 1

Create Snake constructor that takes location
Create MoveBy that takes delta_loc
Create Grow()
Create Draw that takes brd

We want each segment follow the next segment until it reaches head segment, then head moves in delta_loc

Create Follow that takes Segment& next
Create Draw segment 
Create InitHead( location) and InitBody()

Create headColor and bodyColor

In Snake Initializer InitHead with loc

Do the MovyBy
Add MoveBy in Segment And run segments MoveBy on head

Do the Grow()
Do the Draw()!!

InitHead in_loc; c = headColor;
InitHead set color

Follow() loc = next.loc

create Add( Location& val ) in Location

Do the segment moveby using loc.Add
assert abs[absolute] delta == 1

Do the sgment Draw using brd
